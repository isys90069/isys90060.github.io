After watching Sick Around the World, pick the country that Reid visited that you were most intrigued by. By "most intrigued by" I mean, which health system would you prefer to get your healthcare from. Write a brief paragraph describing why you chose this system. There is no right or wrong answer to this. This assignment will be peer reviewed, so that you as students can get exposed to other people's thinking.
