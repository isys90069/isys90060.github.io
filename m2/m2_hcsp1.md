<p><span>The World Health Organisation tells us that a </span><em>health system</em><span>, also known as a </span><em>health care or</em> <em>healthcare system</em><span>, </span>consists of all the organisations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. Hospitals, and primary and community clinics, are what come to mind first and foremost. However a health system is larger than just facilities like those, which mainly exist to provide health services to individuals and families. It includes, for example, unpaid carers; behaviour change programs; biomedical researchers; health insurers; occupational health and safety legislation; COVID-19 control campaigns - and lots more.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s class invites you to acquire or review some basic concepts about health care systems. This session is intended to broaden and deepen your thinking about when, where and why we apply information and communication technologies in health care.</p>
