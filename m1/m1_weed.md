<p>If you have a VPN that will generate an American IP address, you can watch this news story about Larry Weed that aired on 20 September 1994 on an American news show. This was what introduced me to Larry Weed, days before I started my graduate studies in informatics, and shaped my whole view of the discipline. (The interview starts at 38:10.)</p>
<p>Below is the transcript of the relevant portion of the news episode:</p>
<p>FOCUS - ONE MAN'S PRESCRIPTION<br />MR. LEHRER: Finally tonight, one doctor's cure for health care. Our Business Correspondent Paul Solman of public station WGBH- Boston reports from Vermont.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Dr. Lawrence Weed not only marches to a different drummer; he marches in a different direction, unusual but intriguing, for it turns out that Dr. Weed, or anyone for that matter, exercises different muscles walking backwards. More intriguing and also unusual is Dr. Weed's crusade to cut health care costs through computers and medical school reform.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: The big problem has been we've been spending all our time talking about how we're going to pay for medical care, and we haven't spent enough time or any time really talking about what it is we're buying.<br />MR. SOLMAN: What it is we're buying, says Dr. Weed, is a hugely expensive system for training doctors which we wind up paying for in the huge fees doctors charge and all the arguably wasteful tests and procedures they order. Weed's first remedy: Take the computer and turn it into the world's cheapest diagnostician, as effective as any doctor.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: There might be fifty or sixty or seventy causes to your problem. Okay? The machine knows all sixty or seventy causes. So I'm no longer dependent upon a human mind to recall all of this, to know all of this, and then to keep score in its head and never slip, because that's asking too much.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Over the past 15 years, Weed has developed software that couples the symptoms of a patient, any patient, with the very latest medical knowledge. Patients long on symptoms, real or imagined, seem especially eager to get with the program.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: [talking to Solman] No weight gain?<br />MR. SOLMAN: No, no.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Carbohydrate craving or binging?<br />MR. SOLMAN: No, no.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Sensations of hunger accompanying these mental or emotional symptoms?<br />MR. SOLMAN: No.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Hypochondriasis or overconcern with health? Do you feel that you're hypochondriacal?<br />MR. SOLMAN: Since I've about one-year-old, so there's nothing - - but yes.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Yes.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Hypochondria and stammering aside, I had been laid low by some nasty fatigue spells the past 18 months. I'm much better now, though I don't always look it, but I'd never gotten a firm diagnosis. One of Dr. Weed's 39 programs, or "couplers," as they're called, is devoted solely to fatigue and depression.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Inertia, lethargy, limbs feel like lead.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Yes, absolutely. Limbs feel like lead; that's the perfect description.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Weed's coupler programs cover every imaginable symptom and cause.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Are you a smoker?<br />MR. SOLMAN: No.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: And you don't drink more than two alcoholic drinks a day?<br />MR. SOLMAN: I do not.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: And you don't have a diet high in Indian corn or millet?<br />MR. SOLMAN: Indian corn or millet?<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Millet, yeah. People who do, it's incredible what happens to some of them.<br />MR. SOLMAN: I mean, now already is more questions than I believe I was asked when I actually went to see a doctor.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Well, let's go through some more and showyou what thoroughness really is.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Now, if I had been a regular patient, there'd have already been a file on my medical history which takes a good chunk of computer memory all by itself, and I'd have had a physical. But in just 20 minutes, Weed's coupler came up with a borderline diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Of the thirteen known symptoms, I'd experienced eight, just enough to make it official according to the CDC, Centers for Disease Control. Now, usually this is an elusive, even controversial, diagnosis and disease. Months of doctors' visits, reading, and phone calls had taught me that much. But here, in minutes, I'd come just as far with a computer program whose knowledge network was being updated daily by people poring over the latest medical literature, more informed than a regular doctor could ever hope to be.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: In other words, don't have people take eight years to go to college and medical school and then four years of residency, memorize, regurgitate, and forget -- get all this, and then hope that every one will go out there and remember every detail and recall it.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Dr. Weed says he's not just pushing better medicine but cheaper medicine. The point is, instead of pricey doctors, almost anyone can administer Weed's computer program, and almost anyone does.<br />WOMAN AT COMPUTER: [talking to patient] Ralph, has your cough lasted more than two weeks?<br />RALPH: No.<br />WOMAN AT COMPUTER: Do you have a temperature with shaking chills?<br />RALPH: No.<br />MR. SOLMAN: At this family practice in Bangor, Maine, the receptionist, the nurse practitioners, and the doctor all use Weed's coupler system. They serve 4,000 patients, comparable offices 750, and they give free testimonials.<br />DR. CHARLES BURGER: I feel very comfortable with this system because I have the assurance that the best medical literature and best medical thinking has been built into this tool, and I can use this at the time of action with the patient. It's really like being a consultant in my own practice.<br />MR. SOLMAN: This is one way to hold down the nation's medical bill, cheaper people replacing doctors, technology replacing people in general, or so says Dr. Weed.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: What we would have is many more people at much less cost who are competent at various points in the symptom. We wouldn't quote -- even try to have "a competent, overall practitioner." That was where the mistake was.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Now, I don't know about you, but the more we listened, the more reasonable Dr. Weed's economic remedy began to sound. And his argument began to sound vaguely familiar -- that doctors have tried to maintain a kind of monopoly over the practice of medicine. It's an argument we'd run into recently at the home of a nurse, Tara Lansen in red, several nurse relatives, and her husband, a neurosurgeon coming up at the end of this camera pan. Tom Lansen was skeptical about computerizing our current system of diagnosis.<br />DR. TOM LANSEN, Neurosurgeon: I think it's scary, frankly, that we're even thinking about abandoning that symptom. When I get desperately ill, I don't want somebody who's trained in an algorithm of medicine. I want a person who's a medical care giver. I want a physician. And I don't know that we want to -- I'm not saying we can't -- I don't know that we want to offer that trend that's been so successful for us in pushing medicine forward. TARA LANSEN: And also very costly, very costly. And now we're saying, wait a minute, we can't afford to spend anymore.<br />DR. TOM LANSEN: I know the health care system is very expensive, but you don't have to look to physicians as the sole cause of that situation.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Dr. Lansen likes to point out that doctors' fees that represent nearly 20 percent of the nation's health care bill, but says Dr. Weed, when you add in the tests, procedures, and hospitalizations that doctors order, the number's closer to 80 percent.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: And then we say it's an $800 billion industry. The way we're doing it, it's going to be $800 trillion, the way we're going.<br />MR. SOLMAN: But will Larry Weed's computer make a tent? Health care economist Uwe Reinhardt isn't so sure.<br />UWE REINHARDT, Economist: If you now took every patient in front of this machine and we are so technology hungry as Americans for every sniffle people will want to be on this machine or they will feel they weren't properly treated. That could actually cost more in the end.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Technology in general, is it cost saving, or does it wind up costing us more?<br />UWE REINHARDT: What technology does, it makes new quality accessible, and then people want it. Think of the airlines. It used to be booked by hand. You planned your trip three months ahead, then it took them about a week or two to book it through Switzerland, and you'd better never change it again, and then they said, well, we could have computers do all this, and then fire all these people who do bookings, because it's so much cheaper. But that's not what happened. What really happened is we now explore 18 different ways to get to Zurich, and we change the day before, and expect to have a seat; even if we change it five hours before, we still expect to have a window seat. And that system will give it to us. So we have computers and even more people booking flights.<br />MR. SOLMAN: In fairness, Weed's cost saving argument doesn't simply rely on replacing Marcus Welby with a Macintosh. He thinks there is gold to be saved in the hills of academe. Back in 1969, Larry Weed came to the University of Vermont to revamp its medical school. But by 1982, he realized the school wasn't ready for radical surgery. Weed left to build his computer diagnosis company. He is, however, invited back for the occasional gadfly lecture.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Maybe there's something wrong with the way we're running the whole operation. Now, take exams, exams, memorize, regurgitate, forget, memorize, regurgitate, forget, year after year, day in and day out. And then they will go out in the world and for the next forty years do the right thing every time. Maybe we shouldn't accept that premise. Maybe those credentials can't mean that much.<br />MR. SOLMAN: In fact, credentials are already losing some of their luster. Doctors are being supplanted by nurses and primary care, for instance, out of economic necessity. Doctors can administer flu shots a lot more cheaply than doctors. And during our visit to a pharmacy in Staten Island, New York, when an old woman had an adverse reaction, the nurses were thoroughly prepared.<br />MARGARET PISCITELLI, Visiting Nurses' Association: We have staffed our flu shot program with two critical care nurses. In the event that any emergency happens, we're able to respond to it immediately on the spot. What we've also done is call in 911 to assess the situation.<br />MR. SOLMAN: In fact, since doctors stopped making house calls, rescue squads have completely taken over the emergency care business. They're trained in months, not years, earn a fraction of what doctors make. To Dr. Weed, they're a case in point.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: We had to have rescue squads. We had to have them either way. We weren't going to have 12 years of training and cost -- so we got volunteers, rescue squads, and they do a very good job. We've got to do that for all of medicine.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Given Weed's argument, we asked him to show us why medical education is both irrelevant and expensive. This is an undergraduate premed class, inorganic chemistry.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: I've taught all these things, myself, and it's just that I'm not sure that this length of training that they have to go through to help somebody say with a broken arm or with a rescue squad, if we need to make that enormous investment, because that shows up in doctors by salary.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Since we happened to be hovering over a hapless premed, we thought we'd find out what she was up to, and if she thought this class was worthwhile.<br />MR. SOLMAN: And you're learning that the EDPA salt is dried only at 80 degrees centigrade because it's composed of EDPA water?<br />FEMALE STUDENT: Right.<br />MR. SOLMAN: So why are you taking this class?<br />FEMALE STUDENT: Well, this class will give me a lot of the techniques that are very important in doing research in the medical field, and most importantly, it allows me to think analytically.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Weed's response; that while analysis is clearly good for MD's going into research, some 95 percent of medical students become practitioners. At up to $20,000 a year for medical school tuition alone, is the expense worthwhile? We posed that question to medical students at the University of Vermont.<br />MR. SOLMAN: How critical is the amount of education you get to what you're going to wind up with? Is there a more cost effective way to do it?<br />MALE MEDICAL STUDENT: Good question.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Good question.<br />MALE MEDICAL STUDENT: Yeah.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Why is it a good question?<br />MALE MEDICAL STUDENT: Well, I think there's a lot of information that we really don't need to learn that I did learn at one time that I have no recollection of and probably will never remember again, and I would have been better off probably learning something more clinically-based.<br />MR. SOLMAN: This is not simply a student's skepticism. Health care economist Uwe Reinhardt says that most people think there's money to be saved on medical education.<br />UWE REINHARDT: An awful lot of what is now being taught is just baggage. I say this because not only Larry Weed says it, many physicians will tell you that the education of a physician is woefully wasteful, that a lot of stuff is taught that seems to be more a hurdle to make you drop out or not get in that's actually a way to maintain the income of physicians more. And I think he's quite right in his critique there. The trouble is he is up against an establishment that so far has lived happily in an enormous cash flow.<br />MR. SOLMAN: To Weed, the problem is not just that these doctors- to-be have to borrow a king's ransom to invest in years of schooling, which they then recoup by charging high fees, it's also that anyone who pays the price and makes it through gets an MD, while a lot of potential doctors never make it that far for no good reason.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Well, if you wanted them to be a brain surgeon and you want skillful hands, did you test that, well, no. The best one in the world might be somebody who's over in the memory plant of IBM doing these unbelievably fine movements and these things who hasn't had any education at all.<br />MR. SOLMAN: You mean making microchips?<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Yeah. Making microchips. And he's just technically unbelievable.<br />DR. TOM LANSEN: There's more to it than just the technical apt.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Neurosurgeon Tom Lansen.<br />DR. TOM LANSEN: I used to have a professor who used to say that he could teach a monkey to operate; the problem was he couldn't teach the monkey when not to operate.<br />MR. SOLMAN: But we asked: What if a computer was calling the shots?<br />DR. TOM LANSEN: I'll remain a doubter for a while because I think there are more things than are objective about making a surgical judgment. There have been times over the past 20 years where I've walked into a patient's room, all the numbers have been right, all the criteria had been met, all the objective data that could be fed to me had been fed to me, all of which said this patient needs this operation, and something in my instinctive apparatus said no can do, this patient is not going to have an operation, not by me, not today.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Well, there's no doubt we all have intuitions. The question we're raising is: Are your intuitions always good?<br />MR. SOLMAN: Whenever you make fundamental changes, says Weed, you scare people who learned the old paradigm.<br />MR. SOLMAN: But then you also, in this case, you're threatening the self-interest of people.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: That's exactly right. You're always -- for instance, if you're going to switch from football to soccer on the campus, who's going to be the most resistant person on the campus? The star football players.<br />MR. SOLMAN: So the point is that the doctors right now --<br />DR. LARRY WEED: They're the star football players.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Well, I guess it's obvious by now that Dr. Weed is on a mission to both improve and economize on medical education and the business of diagnosis, and recently, Dr. Weed went to Washington, where Republican Senator James Jeffords had promised an audience with his colleagues.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: I'd better get some water in case I get --<br />MR. SOLMAN: A vote was in progress, but health care heavyweight Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island joined Jeffords to give a listen.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: Don't give people five years of geography at Harvard and then make them travel without a map on a government program and then wonder everybody's walking, it's so expensive.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Weed drew from a store house of one-liners, but it was too new, too much, too fast, given the time constraints.<br />SENATOR: This is fascinating. I'm sorry we have to --<br />DR. LARRY WEED: We have to quit now?<br />SENATOR: Yes. We've got seven and a half minutes to get over there.<br />MR. SOLMAN: It was time for the floor vote. The health care renaissance would have to wait.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: How do they solve any problem? I spent 45 years working on something. And he's got but 10 minutes.<br />MR. SOLMAN: Dr. Weed was predictably disappointed, predictably undaunted. Although he'd failed to sell his couplers to Congress, he'll continue his quest to bring them to market.<br />DR. LARRY WEED: You know, they say the fellow who developed the Xerox Machine traveled the country for seven years trying to get somebody to buy this thing. You know, what they all said? Who would want all of those copies?<br />MR. SOLMAN: Eventually, however, Weed believes, people wise up. They bought copies. They'll buy couplers. It's just going to take time. But why has it been such a long haul for Larry Weed?<br />UWE REINHARDT: I think there are several reasons. For one, I would say for about ten, fifteen years, he literally was ahead of technology. Secondly, I don't believe in his extensive reading, Dale Carnegie's book on How to Win Friends and Influence People was on the list, or if it was, that's the one he skipped. He has a way of communicating that can be abrasive, and then thirdly, the cost savings are not demonstrated.<br />MR. SOLMAN: But says Reinhardt, Dr. Weed's time may finally be here now that personal computers are ubiquitous and managed care companies would rather save money than win friends. In fact, a large hospital chain and even the army have recently paid calls to see how much Weed's couplers might save. Still, he hasn't heard from any med schools yet. Larry Weed remains a long way from vindication for all those years of marching to a different drummer. But he finally is getting others to hear the beat, and who knows to what new horizons that might lead. RECAP<br />MR. MAC NEIL: Again, the major story of this Tuesday, more U.S. troops peacefully arrived in Haiti, raising the occupation force to about 6,000. Haitian police clashed with pro-Aristide demonstrators in the capital, Port-au-Prince. At least one person was beaten to death. U.S. troops witnessed some of the violence but did not intervene. Good night, Jim.<br />MR. LEHRER: Good night, Robin. We'll see you tomorrow night. I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.</p>
