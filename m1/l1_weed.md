## Where Did Reed's Rebellion Originate?

### The contrast between

* The careful, thoughtful methodology of his basic science lab work: "I worked with one or two problems until I understood them, wrote up my findings, and got them published in a journal."
* And the chaotic, frantic, multitasking of the clinic

----------------------------------

"The beginning clinical clerk, the new intern, and the practicing physician are confronted with an apparent contradiction. Each is asked, as a ‘whole’ physician, to accept the obligations of meeting many problems simultaneously and yet to give to each the single-minded attention that is fundamental to developing and mobilizing his or her enthusiasm and skill—for these two virtues do not arise except where an organized concentration upon a particular subject is possible."

---------------------------

"In the mid-19th century, the mortality rate from puerperal (or “childbed”) fever at Vienna General Hospital's maternity ward was so high that many women, it is said, preferred to give birth in the street.

“Then a doctor called Ignaz Semmelweis achieved a dramatic reduction in deaths by insisting that doctors wash their hands between autopsies and obstetrical examinations.

[/columns]

--------------------------

"But other doctors refused to believe that their own hands transferred disease. Besides, they grumbled, hand-washing was far too time-consuming. Dr Semmelweis was widely ridiculed and eventually fired."

## Interesting Introduction?

## SOAP Documentation

Larry Weed became famous in the 1960s by tackling the non-scientific nature of medical documentation. He introduced the SOAP (Subject, Objective, Assessment, Plan) method of documentation. That is now almost universally used in medicine.

## SOAP Notes

* Subjective: What the patient says about herself and her condition
* Objective: What the physicians observes/measures about the patient
* Assessment: Summary of patient, differential diagnoses
* Plan: Next steps in workup or therapy

## Are SOAP Notes Why Medicine Disliked Weed?

$$
\frac{\text{Semmelweis}}{\text{Handwashing}}=\frac{\text{Weed}}{\text{Medical Documentation}} = \text{?}
$$

## Why was Weed so Concerned About Documentation?

* The medical record is the **database** from which medical reasoning proceeds
* Without an accurate, searchable (discoverable) database there can be **no scientific reasoning about a patient**


# Weed the Caustic Rebel

## Weed Challenged the Fundamental Assumptions of Medicine

"The unaided human mind is not a reliable instrument for this processing of information in the solution of patients’ problems. Yet medical education and licensure permit physicians to try exactly that."

 -----------------

"Psychologists proved in the 50’s that doctors cannot do their job."^[paraphrase of Weed talk I heard while in graduate school]

## Who Inspired Weed?

Homer Warner, Francis Bacon, Alfred North Whitehead,

## Francis Bacon's Idols of the Mind

:::incremental
* Universal mental limitations “inherent in human nature”
* Acquired beliefs of human problem solvers "corrupts the light of nature"
* The limits of language "throw everything into confusion"
* Developed systems of thought "which have become inveterate by tradition, implicit credence and neglect."^["For the past 40 years, research by psychologists has confirmed the writings of Bacon."]
:::

-----------------

## Alfred North Whitehead

"It is a profoundly erroneous truism -that we should cultivate the habit of thinking about what we are doing.  The precise opposite is the case.  Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.""

## Robyn Dawes

"The greatest obstacles to using external aids may be the difficulty of convincing ourselves that we should take precautions against ourselves."

# The Last Three Slides Provide the Intellectual Framework for this Course!

## Did Warner and Weed Have Bad Timing?

* Franklin revolted when he “judged the time to be ripe and the costs to be acceptable.”
* They heyday of Warner and Weed’s work was 50 years ago
* Was the time ripe?
* Were the tools of the revolutionaries sufficient?
