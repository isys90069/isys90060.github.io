## Homer Warner, Rebel?

* Eldest Child
* High school and university quarterback
* Navy pilot

## HW: Rebellion against *His* Ignorance

:::incremental
* "When I finished medical school I thought I knew everything...."
* "But when I finished my internship I realized I didn’t know anything...""
* "And I didn’t want to be in that state."
* Went to pursue PhD at the University of Minnesota
:::

## HW: Rebellion with Curiosity

* Analog computers to analyze cardiac pressure waveforms
    * Taught him more of his ignorance
    * Studied engineering math
* In 1960 University of Utah gets first digital computer
    * “How can I justify learning how to program?”

\note{}    


## HW: Rebellion with Digital Computer

* Model (sacred domain of) diagnostic process
* Bayesian diagnosis of congenital heart problems
* JAMA 1961
    * First paper describing computer-aided decision support with real patient data

\note{}


## HW: Rebellion against *Others'* Ignorance

Homer's most important contributions were rooted in a chance encounter with a nurse in an ICU

------------------------

>One day Warner went down to visit the ICU and there was a nurse over one of the beds pumping up a blood pressure cuff on the left arm of a patient who had a catheter in the artery on the right arm to monitor the pressure.

------------------------

>There was a yellow light on the panel. The nurse was embarrassed when she saw him watching her and explained she didn’t know what to do next.

------------------------

>They sat down at the computer terminal and looked at all the data both in the computer and in the chart. They called the resident and jointly decided that the patient probably was having a cardiac tamponade.

------------------------

>They called the surgeon who promptly took the patient back to the operating room.



# Eureka Moment

---------------------------------

“It was clear to him that just providing data and displaying it in a variety of ways may not be an adequate solution to the decision-making problem.


-------------------

"This nurse clearly needed help in the interpretation of the data and that interpretation required more data than just the hemodynamic measurements in the computer….[M]ost of all it required that the **computer have some medical knowledge.** They needed to build some intelligence into the system."

## HELP

* Health Evaluation Through Logical Processing (HELP)
* An electronic medical record explicitly to facilitate decision support


## The heresy of HELP

* Use computers to bring “expert” knowledge to “lower level” providers
    * Knowledge near the patient
* Flatten the hierarchy

## Homer and Socrates

>“Well, although I do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good, I am better off than he is, —for he knows nothing, and thinks that he knows; I neither know nor think that I know. In this latter particular, then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him.” (Apology)
