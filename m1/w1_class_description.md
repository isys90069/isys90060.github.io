Homer Warner at his analog computer; the very beginnings of biomedical
i.nformatics

This class will introduce the students to the basic concepts that
motivate research and development in e-health and biomedical
informatics. This will be done largely by introducing students to two of
the early pioneers in medical informatics: Homer Warner and Larry Weed.
Homer Warner introduces us to the idea of ignorance and how ignorance
led to one of the most important biomedical informatics systems. Larry
Weed introduces us to the limits of human cognition and reminds us of
how Francis Bacon enumerated four Idols of the Mind that will be
important for us throughout the term. Definitions of health, disease,
biomedical and informatics will be examined.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completing the materials for this class the student will be able to

-   Describe different definitions of health and disease and describe
    how these definitions would affect the design of informatics systems
-   Explain how ignorance led to the development of the HELP system
-   Explain Weed\'s concept of a a medical document and how it relates
    to medical care.
-   Provide several definitions of health and discuss how different
    definitions of health might lead to differences in the scope of
    practiceÂ 
-   List Francis Bacon\'s four Idols of the Mind.
