---------------

The framework for this lecture comes from an essay ["The Scientist as Rebel"](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1995/05/25/the-scientist-as-rebel/) Professor Dyson published in the New York Review of Books in 1995 and later republished in his collection of essays, also title *The Scientist as Rebel* (2006 New York Review of Books)

--------------------

## Who Was Freeman Dyson?

One of the most influential physicists of the 20th century who made important contributions to^[Wikipedia]

* quantum electrodynamics
* solid-state physics
* astronomy
* nuclear engineering.



# Science as rebellion:

----------------------------
\small

>There is no such thing as a unique scientific vision, any more than there is a unique poetic vision. Science is a mosaic of partial and conflicting visions. But there is one common element in these visions. The common element is rebellion against the restrictions imposed by the locally prevailing culture, Western or Eastern as the case may be.

----------------------

# Dyson's ideal Scientist as Rebel was  [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin)

--------------------------------

"Benjamin Franklin combined better than anyone else the qualities of a great scientist and a great rebel. As a scientist, without formal education or inherited wealth, he beat the learned aristocrats of Europe at their own game....

---------------------

"Franklinâ€™s triumph as a rebel resulted from the fact that his rebellion was not impulsive but was carefully thought out over many years."^[Dyson 2006 p. *ix*]

-------------------------


"If science ceases to be a rebellion against authority, then it does not deserve the talents of our brightest children."^[Dyson 2006, p. 7]

## Successful Rebellion Requires Judiciousness

"Franklin became a rebel only when he judged the time to be ripe and the costs to be acceptable. As a rebel he remained a conservative, aiming not to destroy but to preserve as much as possible of the established order of society.""

## Is Anyone Born to Rebel?

![*Born to Rebel*](./media/born-to-rebel-vintage-books-edition.jpeg)

--------------------------

## Not Firstborns!

At least according to the historian of science Frank J. Sulloway

* Benjamin Franklin was not a first born child.

## Two Medical Informatics Rebels

* Homer Warner
* Larry Weed

# Is Rebellion a Relevant Term?

## Thesis

***Biomedical Informatics is a rebellion against the status quo of the health care system regarding:***

* Who has information
* How the information is used
* What information is used

## Who are the Protagonists and Antagonists in this Revolution?

## What are the Weapons of this Informatics Rebellion?

Digital computers and communication technologies

## What are the Ideologies Behind the Revolution

* The unaided human mind is ill suited for practicing modern medicine
* Effective and efficient healthcare is fundamental need for human flourishing
