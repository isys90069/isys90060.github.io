Homer Warner is largely, and certainly by me, considered to be the founder of biomedical informatics. He made several foundational contributions to computer-assisted diagnosis, he founded one of the first academic journals dedicated to biomedical informatics (Computers and Biomedical Research, now Journal of Biomedical Informatics), and perhaps more importantly. He was a tireless missionary for informatics. This can be appreciated in part, but looking at the figure below which shows how the various contributors to the standard textbook in biomedical inforamtics learned about the field.
